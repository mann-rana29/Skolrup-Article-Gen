# Skolrup Article Generator

A cutting-edge web-based application designed to revolutionize content creation through intelligent automation.

## Overview

The Skolrup Article Generator goes beyond simple text generation, leveraging sophisticated AI to produce high-quality, coherent, and visually rich articles. This project aims to provide a powerful and user-friendly platform for generating comprehensive content, making article creation effortless and efficient.

## Features

### 🧠 Advanced Article Synthesis
Harnesses the power of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate diverse perspectives on a given topic. These articles are then intelligently compared, analyzed, and synthesized into a single, cohesive, and highly informative final article, ensuring depth and breadth of content that a single LLM might miss.

### 🎨 Dynamic Image Generation with Gemini
Elevate your articles with stunning visuals! The generator seamlessly integrates with the Gemini API to create contextually relevant and captivating images that perfectly complement the generated text, bringing your content to life.

### 💻 Intuitive User Interface
A clean and easy-to-use web interface ensures a seamless and enjoyable content generation experience, even for complex tasks.

### 🌐 Cross-Platform Compatibility
Designed to run flawlessly in modern web browsers, providing accessibility across various devices.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Python** (likely with Flask or FastAPI)
- **Multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)** for text generation and synthesis
- **Gemini API** for dynamic image generation

### Frontend
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Node.js & npm** (or Yarn): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm is included with Node.js)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mann-rana29/Skolrup-Article-Gen.git
cd Skolrup-Article-Gen
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Python)

Navigate into the cloned directory and set up the Python environment. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: If `requirements.txt` is not present, you might need to manually install dependencies like Flask, requests, and any specific AI/ML libraries for LLM interaction and image generation.

### 3. Frontend Setup (TypeScript/JavaScript)

Install the necessary Node.js packages for the frontend.

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

> **Note**: You might need to navigate into a specific frontend directory if the project structure separates backend and frontend.

## Usage

After completing the installation, you can run the application.

### 1. Start the Backend Server

From the root directory of the project (or the backend directory if separated), run the Python application:

```bash
# Assuming the main application file is app.py
python app.py
```

This will typically start the backend server, often on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or a similar address.

### 2. Start the Frontend Development Server

From the root directory (or the frontend directory), start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

This will usually open the application in your default web browser, often on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to the address where the frontend is running (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). You should now be able to interact with the Skolrup Article Generator and experience its intelligent article and image generation capabilities.
